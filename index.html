    <h1>Here is my full Tech Stack recommendation for the given prompt:</h1>
    <p><em>
        "I would like to create an app that I can take with me in the state forest, and when I
        encounter certain flora, fauna or points of interest (unique trees, rocks, animals, etc), I
        can snap a photo of it, log in to this app, upload the photo, and store a description about
        it. I would like anyone on my team of 3-5 researchers to have the ability. My team should
        each have their own unique logins to manage the POIs. I would like the POIs that I upload to be displayed on a website for the public to see,
        overlayed onto a map of the state forest, so others can go observe these unique
        findings. Users on the website should not need to log in to view the map."

    </ol>
    <h2>Front-End Frameworks</h2>
    <p>
        My thought process coming into this prompt is to create an app that utilizes the least amount of frameworks, code, and overall
        clutter. I wanted to find the right tools that would allow for all of the features above to be implemented, and even more could
        be implemented in the future, if necessary. That being said, for the Front-End, I would recommend using React Native with the help of Expo. React in general is a comfort pick
        when it comes to creating web applications which utilizes React components, which makes it much easier to break down a
        project such as creating an app like this. Furthermore, I would recommend React Native specifically because
        React Native in comparison to ReactJS allows for instant compatibility with Mobile Devices. React Native allows us to
        create one app that will be compatible with any device that it assesses, and with it we're also allowed to change features
        based on the device (iOS, Android, Web) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gvkqT_Uoahw">[React Native in 100 Seconds: 1:00 - 1:07]</a>
        <a href="https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/react-js-vs-react-native-whats-the-difference/#:~:text=Here's%20the%20main%20difference%20between,%2C%20cross%2Dplatform%20mobile%20applications">[React Native vs ReactJS]</a>
        <br><br>
        As for Expo, Expo would be a great toolkit that is used in conjunction with React Native. With Expo, there is a built in feature
        from its SDK called <a href="https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/sdk/camera/">Camera</a>, which is exactly what we need in order for
        our User to take pictures of their desired POIs. Expo also has a built in feature called <a href="https://docs.expo.dev/versions/v48.0.0/sdk/location/">Expo Location</a>
        which allows us to take Geolocation data from the device which would be useful in helping us map out the POIs. I should also note that not
        all of the given tools from Expo are installed, we can pick and choose which ones we would like to use, more information on that <a href="https://docs.expo.dev/versions/latest/">here.</a>
    </p>
    <h2>Back-End Technologies</h2>
    <p>
        The Back-End is considered the backbone of the entire stack. It will store all of the important data, information that is important
        to run the website, which is why I've broken it down to separate components:
        <ul>
            <ul>User Logins</ul>
            <p>
                Given the prompt, the important thing I noted was that there would be 2 versions of the app, one for the public
                to view which would contain all of the user's uploaded POIs and descriptions, and another version that would include
                the features of everything our User would need to upload said POIs and descriptions. That being said, what is most important
                is to have the User Logins separating both versions, where the first version of the site is the default, until the User/User's team
                logs in.
                <br><br>
                For the User's logins, MongoDB Atlas is what I choose to go with. I'm choosing MongoDB Atlas for many reasons that I will get
                to in further points, but MongoDB Atlas has a built in login feature that will work precisely how we want it in this situation.
            </p>
            <ul>User Security and Authentication</ul>
            <p>
                Data and privacy are very important, especially when it comes to these logins. Alongside MongoDB Atlas which will be handling
                the logins, I propose that we use Auth0. The reason that I choose Auth0 is because of its simplistic and its compatible nature with
                what we already have in our Stack (MongoDB Atlas, Realm, React Native). Not only are they a trusted source to use when it comes to User Authentication, they are also
                highly reliable and there is much flexibility when it comes to our options of what features we want to implement/customize.
                <a href="https://auth0.com/why-auth0">[Why Auth0?]</a>
            </p>
            <ul>Uploaded POIs</ul>
            <p>
                The data that will be primarily uploaded is the Image of the flora, fauna, and POIs, the location of the POIs, and the description
                of what the flora, fauna, and POI represent. What we will be using primarily to handle all of this work is MongoDB Atlas. I would argue
                that MongoDB Atlas is the mere staple to everything that we are using, and it ties everything from the mapping to the front end display
                that we would need to display the findings of the User and his Team. That being said, the primary reason for using MongoDB Atlas is because
                of its compatibility, and also because of the work it can do for the job we need to get done, which in this case is making sure that our data
                doesn't become cluttered or messy.
                <br><br>
                MongoDB Atlas is arguably the most important tool in the stack, because it will interact with both the front-end framework of React Native
                and Expo, and the back-end technologies of MapBox GL JS, in order to sync everything together and have the data readily available on all ends.
            </p>
            <ul>Offline Data Synchronization</ul>
            <p>
                The scenario that our User loses internet connection on his phone, the solution to that would be embedded within
                both MongoDB Atlas and the Realm database. The reason that I choose the Realm database to handle offline data Synchronization
                is because of its client side <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/realm-legacy/solutions/offline-first.html">nature</a>, which is
                exactly what we need in order to sync offline data. Since the data will be operating on the User's device, when the User's
                internet connection cuts out, they are able to still upload their desired POIs with their descriptions (which will be stored
                using MongoDB Atlas), and when the internet connection comes online again, then Atlas will be able to sync it directly with the
                server. An example of this is listed <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/docs/atlas/app-services/sync/">here</a>
            </p>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <h2>Mapping Technologies</h2>
    <p>
        For Mapping, the recommended software MapBox GL JS is the best choice for the task. Mapbox GL JS is extremely useful not only for mapping
        out the location(state forest for this case), it would also be the tool we need in order to map out the POIs. The reason why I
        highly recommend Mapbox GL JS is not only because of its easy and effective use, but also because of its seamless compatibility with
        React.
        <br><br>
        MapBox GL JS allows us to map out the POIs, my interest in particular would be in how the data is displayed on the website. This is an
        <a href="https://blog.mapbox.com/search-points-of-interest-by-radius-with-mapbox-gl-js-2c5caad44e5c">example</a> of how POIs would be able
        to appear on the website that visitors are allowed to see the many different flora, fauna, or POIs that the User and his team have
        uploaded. There are also many other <a href="https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/example/">examples</a> we could play around with if we
        choose to work with MapBox GL JS.
        <br><br>
        Additionally, for creating maps using MapBox GL JS, I would recommend using Figma, more specifically Figma's built-in plugin called
        Mapsicle in order to render and edit these custom maps easily, here is an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Skwqiso22I">example</a> on how it would look.
        <br><br>
        I would also like to note that MapBox GL JS is HIGHLY compatible with MongoDB Atlas and Realm, which makes our job easy in terms of connecting
        together. Here is an <a href="https://www.mongodb.com/developer/products/mongodb/searching-nearby-points-interest-mapbox/">article</a> that addresses how it would work.
        Here is also another <a href="https://www.thepolyglotdeveloper.com/2020/06/real-time-location-updates-realm-change-streams-mapbox/">example</a> on how the location of the User would be tracked using MapBox GL JS, MongoDB Atlas, and Realm working hand by hand.
    </p>
    <h2>Honorable Mentions</h2>
    <p>
        My initial thought when reading this prompt was to use Supabase, as aside from being a database, it also has many amazing
        capabilities such as unique logins, authentication, that would be an all in one. However, after doing some research, I came
        to the conclusion that in conjunction with MongoDB Atlas and Mapbox GL JS, it would take much more work and custom coding in order
        to get it to work.
        <br><br>
        CouchDB and PouchDB work in conjunction with each other, and they are an honorable mention because PouchDB is known to be lightweight
        and easy to use. The reason I decided not to use them is because in order to use CouchDB and PouchDB alongside Mapbox GL JS, it would
        require some custom coding in order to make it happen, and in that case, the pros don't outweigh the cons of more unnecessary work.
        <br><br>
        OpenLayers is another alternative I found compared to MapBox GL JS. The reason I didn't choose OpenLayers is because in comparison to
        MapBox GL JS, its UI and overall compatibility with MongoDB Atlas and Realm I didn't find as practical. 
    </p>
    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
        I've given my recommendations for a Tech Stack designated towards the given prompt, but how would this look in theory?
        To summarize, let's take our User as an example. He is in the forest with his internet connection, he opens the web app
        on his iPhone, and he signs in using his credentials. He then moves forth with his journey, and finds a flower that is unique.
        He takes a picture of the flower, and our app would register the description and image using MongoDB Atlas and Realm, and then our app would also take the location of the picture, which would be uploaded as a POI,
        displayed on the main website using MapBox GL JS, and that would be possible with the help of MongoDB Atlas and Realm feeding that GeoJSON
        data to MapBox GL JS. Our User decides to go further into the forest, noticing that his cellular data has cut off, he would still
        be able to take a picture of another flower he found, and our app would be able to store all of the data directly in his phone(client-side), utilizing Realm,
        and after his journey in the forest, then he is able to fully have it uploaded to the database, more specifically where Realm and 
        MongoDB Atlas is able to finally communicate. After it is uploaded, all of his findings will immediately be available for viewing by the World Wide Web.
